# R U Hungry App 🍔
<hr>

This is a continuation from my R U Hungry Console App.
The project can be viewed live here ----> https://stately-unicorn-e05667.netlify.app/

The app is called R U Hungry and is able to generate a 3 course menu for the user - displaying a starter, main and dessert.
The user can generate new random menus until they are happy with the suggestions. They can then click on view menu and a new tab will open for recipes of each suggested menu item so the user can get cooking!  🍗🍔😋

The app uses the localStorage of the browser so that the user can also add their own items. Providing whether it is a starter main or dessert. 
The user can then save this and it will be set into the localStorage so that future menu generations will incorporate these additions from the user. This allows the user to customize the base menu to their preferences and tastes. 

The app incorporates logic so that it will check if their is localStorage being used, then fetch and use it. If not it sets a base default menu. 
It also has some logic to ensure that the user is entering a correct course such as starter, main or dessert. 


**NB** -  pop ups may need to be disabled so that all three recipe pages will open when requested. 
If view menu is clicked and only one recipe opens, navigate back to the site and click allow pop ups and then click 'View Menu' again and it should work.
